13975,@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?,0
13986,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems,0

14039,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.,0
14041,@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out,0
14044,"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks.",0
14063,@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH,0
14064,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.,0
