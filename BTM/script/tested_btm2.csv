569,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.,1

636,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.",1
637,@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.,1

2091,"@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD",1
2095,@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed,1

2109,@united YOU SUCK!,1
2119,"@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?",1
2124,@united i will never fly with you again. i went on vacation this week and you lost my bags both ways. now i have no clothes. thankyou,1
2125,@united sadly this wasnt just due to mother nature investigate this incident and your employees at sfo. Terrible customer experience,1

2130,@united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/7br5t5QCXk (via @ParachuteGuy),1
2132,@united Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though!,1
2145,@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter,1
2153,@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?,1
2161,@united has once again earned a place as the worst airline in the business,1
2172,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm.",1
2173,@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..,1
2175,@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics,1
2179,@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.,1
2180,@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!,1
2182,@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.,1
2194,@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter,1
2195,@united you're terrible.,1
2210,@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.,1
2212,@united is the worst,1
2218,"@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful.",1
2219,@united any plans of restating nonstop service between IAD and South Florida?  We miss our flights to FLL.,1
2221,"@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight.",1
2222,@united following,1
2231,@united And yet we still haven't left yet and I can't watch my pre-paid DirectTV. #firstworldproblems,1
2233,.@united Let us know when you find everyone's luggage. Thanks. #UnitedAirlines,1
2240,@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?,1
2249,@united I was on UA1069 today and left my sunglasses in seat 26F. Please help me get them back! #UnitedAirlines,1
2250,@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!,1
2251,@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks,1
2252,@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.,1
2253,"@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!",1
2258,@united never again.,1
2260,@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?,1
2261,@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.,1
2262,@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest,1
2267,@united you really do have a culture problem. Everyone I tried to work with blamed someone else or told me how they're short staffed,1
2268,@united sucks.,1
2275,@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed,1
2277,"@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.",1
2278,@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.,1
2280,@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212,1
2282,"@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me.",1
2283,"@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!",1

2300,@united employees almost seem happy when delivery terrible customer service.,1
2306,@united i'm glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United,1
2308,"@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?",1
2319,@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?,1
2324,"@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance",1
2326,@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround,1
2331,@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines,1
2333,"@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt",1
2339,"@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!",1
2351,@united this flight has been amazing. This is the best flight I have ever been on I am not kidding. Service is INCREDIBLE!,1
2352,@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care,1
2353,@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.,1
2359,"@united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain",1
2360,@united great job losing one of my six bags on a direct flight.  Don't know how you manage to do it.,1
2361,@united the worst customer service in Denver.,1
2363,@united So what's allowed or what's not allowed to be carried in my checked baggage?,1
2364,@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse,1
2365,@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals,1
2368,@united I need #United to be a better airline!!,1
2382,@united I'm flying UA but *G with A3,1
2390,@united 4 of us are stranded   And flying from New Orleans to Huston tonight and we will be stuck there for two days. Rather fly than wait.,1
2401,.@united Thanks. Hopefully this is easily resolved.,1
2404,@united why are you charging people to see the freaking flight map? https://t.co/AgPb45v8wt,1
2406,@united is not a company that values it's customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I'm not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness,1
2411,"@united I'm aware, I fly a lot :) Just sad I had to change my shoes (boots), ha! #HappyFlight",1
2416,@united Worst customer non-service for sure!,1
2417,@united Worst airline ever?,1
2421,@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks,1
2427,@united I take it as a compliment that I was mistaken several times as a member of your staff on my flight... time to remove my scarf :),1
2433,@united Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me.,1
2434,"@united Great!  I'm guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you're overcharging, and don't care that everyone is miserable.",1

2465,@United had a maintenance issue. Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won't even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really.,1
2470,.@united too much info to share via tweet. Please send me your name and contact info. Happy to supply you with images and CS rep names.,1
2471,@united once again your lack of customer service astounds me! You are the worst airline in the history of airlines! Train your staff!,1
2472,@united Extremely disappointed in #Flight6831. United left crew and pssgrs stranded in rain @ gate with no cover. Left Psngrs 2 depart plane,1
2473,"@united besides landing the plane, overall customer service experience has been poor. Late Flight and rude workers plus missing luggage",1
2482,"@united oh, the Wi-Fi router is on top of the fuselage! ;)",1
2497,@united Finally I get the right response. United must check this issue. UA 1514 EWR to PUJ on Friday 02/20/15.,1
2500,@united lost bag in Huston we leave for a Bahamas cruise today from #nola and had to buy all new stuff. Customer service is non existent,1
2503,@united Very impressed so far. An app that's worth a damn and sms updates on my flight.,1
2505,@united just had the worst customer service experience ever on united airlines,1
2506,@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE,1
2508,@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!,1
2511,@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines,1
2514,"@united I was, just very surprised it took over 15 mins. Never experienced anything like that on 1K number",1
2518,"@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable.",1
2525,@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement,1
2533,"@united do you teach your gate agents 2 lie? Or do they just learn on their own? There was overhead space for my bag,  didn't have to check",1
2543,"@united Yes, myself and about 200 other people also.",1
2549,@united provide a voucher for one of my customers and I will tweet about you all day long #earnedmybusiness,1

2557,"@united my flight out of BGM Cancelled Flightled last night, I get a hotel voucher, but had to pay for a cab back. Worse cab experience ever",1

2570,@united  thank you for a great flight in gfc :) Cheers http://t.co/nvLnGLnMGN,1
2571,@united bad customer service  to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on,1
2572,@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff,1
2574,"@united @danahajek : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can't respond b/c she's alone",1
2585,@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.,1
2592,@united On last flight of the day no less. I am now driving 4 hours to Aspen thru a snowstorm Thx to your teams lack of customer empathy,1

2609,"@united I have a voucher that expires next week, can I get an extension on it before it expires?",1

2613,"@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service",1
2616,"@united Brian at SFO customer service deserves a raise, gave me extra meal voucher and a good joke to cheer me up after flight delay. #FTW",1
2619,@united it most certainly was not.,1
2622,@united No thanks.  Took care of it when I called,1
2632,@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer,1
2634,"@united ""most likely"" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks.",1
2635,@united tell me something I don't know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea,1
2636,@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally,1
2640,@united never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best.,1
2642,@united where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost,1

2659,@united I miss the Continental days.,1
2663,"@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?",1
2670,@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.,1
2672,"@united passengers seated, crew ready #WheresThePilot? Flt1088 from ORD. Hope he isn't at the bar.",1
2674,@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.,1
2677,@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...,1
2678,@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!,1
2680,@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.,1

2696,@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M,1
2697,@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.,1

2701,"@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes ""like every 15 minutes."" Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?",1
2707,@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.,1
2709,@united I have flown with you 10 times in the last 13 days. 8 out of 10 flights have been delayed. Huge mistake on my part. Don't fly united,1
2710,@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!,1
2713,@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year &amp; she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!,1
2714,@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.,1
2716,@united you suck. @SouthwestAir you're the best.,1
2717,@United can you let us out of the gate now. UA1157,1

2723,"@united, if you mean beyond opaque ""maintenance issues"", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage.",1
2728,@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!,1
2732,@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.,1
2733,@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.,1
2735,@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?,1
2743,"@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA",1
2745,@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing,1
2747,@united your agents forced me to check a carry on bag. When I received my bag I found your crew had stolen from me. U lost my business!,1
2748,@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! üëç,1
2749,@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!,1
2754,@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.,1
2761,@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable,1
2762,@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD--&gt;MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!,1
2765,"@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd.",1
2768,@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues,1
2770,@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock,1
2773,"@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it‚Äôs not 1997 anymore.",1
2776,@united Lindsay and ??.  Darn.  Terrible memory on my part.  I know they are headed back to IAD and then PIT tonight.,1
2777,"@united I know. I‚Äôm sure you hear it all the time ‚Äî don‚Äôt like the new seats. I‚Äôm a small guy, 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and I feel the new planes are tight",1
2788,@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!,1
2791,"@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo",1
2793,"@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner.",1
2795,@united how long does it take for customer feedback to respond to a complaint?,1
2797,@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight,1
2802,@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated,1
2806,@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks,1

2813,@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.,1
2814,"@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $.",1
2815,@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH,1
2816,@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.,1
2820,@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.,1
2824,@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.,1
2827,"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly.",1
2832,@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.,1

2932,@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.,1
2933,@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?,1

2949,@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!,1
2951,@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other,1
2952,@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied,1
2953,@united Without baggage for 5 days and can't get an update from Houston airport since Monday. Worst service ever!,1

10615,@USAirways So no idea? Thanks...,1
10618,@USAirways yes. But the manner with which it was done was harsh for those affected. Already checked in. No remorse. Weak alternatives.,1

13838,@AmericanAir Thanks for your canned response that makes it look like you care about your customers. I'm sure all Twitter users fall for it..,1
13842,"@AmericanAir is the new @SpiritAirlines, and both are worse than taking the @GreyhoundBus #americanairlines #nocustomerservice #fail",1

13848,@AmericanAir one staff on desk. Now been queuing for over an hr.,1

13857,"@AmericanAir LTALJX, from DCA to OMA this morning. All of the staff that helped me fix my problem were so helpful. #goodthingscome #thanks",1

13859,@AmericanAir wow @AmericanAir still screw n stuff up,1
13861,@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!,1
13862,"@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, ""not yet located""?",1
13865,@AmericanAir not yet. I'm next in the terminal a customer service area.,1
13868,@AmericanAir you have let me down. Seriously. #unhappycustomer,1
13869,@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?,1
13874,"@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer",1
13876,"@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic",1
13881,@AmericanAir  is the worst airline to ever travel with!!!! The worst!! They're equivalent to DIRT!!!!!!,1
13882,@AmericanAir great flight experience again... SFO-JFK... Dare I say it? A consistent high quality on a legacy airline? Keep it up guys!,1
13884,@AmericanAir Great - thank you.,1
13889,"@AmericanAir jal and cathay pacific so no, I can't do it online.",1
13894,@AmericanAir Hey so I'm very disappointed with my time traveling with you! I've had the worst experience and both times the flight delayed!,1
13904,@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.,1
13911,@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.,1
13924,@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever,1
13926,@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?,1
13927,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault,1
13928,@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.,1
13931,@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.,1
13949,@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted,1
13962,@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service),1
13963,@AmericanAir I fortunately was not on that flight - just in the same waiting area / impressed w how he handled the stressful situation,1
13965,@AmericanAir thanks to Marie for reFlight Booking Problems me and my friends!!! I'm Cali bound thanks to this sweet angel! #blessed,1
13976,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!",1
13984,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.,1
14008,@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.,1
14012,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane üò¢üòïüò¶ #AmericanAirlines",1
14016,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items,1
14019,@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.,1
14022,@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!,1
14027,"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful üò≥",1
14029,@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.,1
14034,"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight.",1
14042,@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293,1
14043,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice,1
14047,@AmericanAir Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can't do both. Can you help?,1
14049,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.",1
14073,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses.",1
14074,@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.,1
14086,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center,1
14088,Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one planeüò°,1
14090,@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!,1
14100,"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or....",1
14102,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful,1
14103,"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got",1
14105,@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs,1
14109,"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?",1
14110,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.,1
14114,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.,1
14118,"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots",1
14123,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth,1
14127,@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?,1
14137,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it,1
14146,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.,1
14147,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..,1
14159,"@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz.",1
14169,@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.,1
14170,"@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins",1
14172,@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault,1
14177,@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.,1
14180,@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.,1
14187,@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...,1
14194,@americanair @bershawnjackson big UPS to Newark airport staff &amp;&amp; D.Dean. I was also treated lovely while I was in town. ‚ù§‚ù§,1
14195,@AmericanAir pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :(,1
14197,"@AmericanAir Hey, so... I think I left my wallet on you. Can I have it back, please?",1
14198,"@AmericanAir ok, thanks you! Have a great night AA team!",1
14206,@AmericanAir we're still here guys - you are the worst,1
14212,@AmericanAir absolutely worse cust. Svc ever experienced in 25 yrs of flying.  Supvrs at iah extremely rude. #poorservice #travel,1
14213,"@AmericanAir Kid upset, my staff upset (one accused of stealing fruit!!!!!) mistreatment due to airline policy of an Austic child.",1
14218,@AmericanAir flight from JFK to EGE was cxld after on runway for an hour. Flight moved to 7am but they won't give luggage back. Nice.,1
14222,@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta,1
14226,"@AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it's winter! staff better",1
14229,@AmericanAir Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.  Going to miss my connection.  No words from staff. Maybe some damn pretzels?,1
14255,"@AmericanAir 's computer systems are down, can't leave without a flight plan! Any ETA, American air?",1
14260,@AmericanAir please pray for us that our gear is not lost or stolen due to YOUR incompetent employees. #CNN #ABCNews #MSNBC #Photography,1
14276,@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer,1
14279,@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!,1
14290,@AmericanAir why don't you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines,1
14291,@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.,1
14303,@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.,1
14304,"@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports AA1224: 45 mins for Priority bags to arrive, now Late Flight for evening plans! Delta 20 min bag guarantee anyone? :(",1
14307,@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head,1
14315,"@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me",1
14321,"@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way.",1
14322,@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ‚úà :-),1
14325,@AmericanAir Just landed - crew couldn't have been more gracious or accommodating. Although a long delay I appreciate your prompt response!,1
14333,@AmericanAir that's if it is ever complete and if i can ever get through customer service #theydontanswer,1
14338,@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst,1
14340,@AmericanAir served me rubber pasta covered In sauce that tastes like plastic. Do you have any food for human consumption anymore ?,1
14341,"@AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait ""over 2 hours"" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake?",1
14345,@AmericanAir TY Can you confirm or deny if AA953 left JFK? I want to figure out if more delays are in store. Internet giving different info.,1
14349,@AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.,1
14357,@AmericanAir the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16),1
14358,@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports Do you guys teach poor customer service or is it just part of an american dream?,1
14360,@AmericanAir I would like to thank the customer service team for their response to my Cancelled Flightled flight but just offering to (cont),1
14363,@AmericanAir yes called your UK number on skype‚Ä¶well worth the $.50.  i recommend others do the same.,1
14369,@AmericanAir you suck worst airline ever I will never be flying you again I have been stuck here for 13 hours no one is helping #fuckoff,1
14374,@AmericanAir RDU Customer Service is awesome. Thanks! Give em all bonuses.,1
14375,@AmericanAir I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time.,1
14389,@AmericanAir I did. Should i expect a response in this fiscal year? This calendar year? Never?,1
14396,@AmericanAir your service is horrible. I can't get a straight answer from your ground agents.,1
14398,@AmericanAir Yes. Your service in GUC sucks. Your gate agent pushed a passenger and has been rude to everyone since we got here.,1
14400,@AmericanAir After 3 days NO BAGs amazing the way that you neglect customers,1
14401,@AmericanAir Worst airline ever. We have been stranded for 24 hours because of your 7 hour delay with flight 104 last night.,1
14420,"@AmericanAir 245. I'm about to take off but one of your reps at a different gate was rude when I asked for assistance. Thanks, though.",1
14425,"@AmericanAir really American Airlines , service is Las Vegas is shocking, absolute jokers take your reputation more seriously!",1
14435,"@AmericanAir That's a complete cop out! U ask what the issues are, then do nothing about it. How are we supposed to sort the situation now?",1
14453,"@AmericanAir @karabuxthomps Yeah, I have a lot of questions, number one: how dare you",1
14458,"@AmericanAir you think I haven't tried that multiple times?? The ""status"" of my bag is that it should've been here YESTERDAY. So disgusted.",1
14459,@AmericanAir thnkx bt dont help now we will need to go WAY out of OUR way to get where we NEED to be for the $ u charge this sux #neveragain,1
14463,@AmericanAir leave our luggage in the baggage claim without any previous information! That's not the deal!! http://t.co/oTTy5rYMzD,1
14468,"@AmericanAir 

Fantastic support by the Twitter team. I appreciate it. Thanks again.",1
14481,"@AmericanAir appreciate update. Have also appreciated our pilots effort to explain to us just now. Accurate, authoritative comms is vital.",1
14483,@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.,1
14487,".@AmericanAir Also, not the reservations team's fault. Bad top-down decision. I feel bad for the reservations AND social media teams.",1
14512,@AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.,1
14513,@AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through...,1
14517,@AmericanAir nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations,1
14523,@AmericanAir ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn,1
14527,"@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever.",1
14528,@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies,1
14530,"@AmericanAir thanks for forcing me to check -in my carry - on luggage. That is exactly why I spent extra money on ""travel size"" toiletries",1
14538,"@AmericanAir Cool, a canned response. Nah, I think I'll keep tweeting at everyone who mentions AA on Twitter. You could DM me, though.",1
14544,@AmericanAir   You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.,1
14546,@AmericanAir how realistic is it to make an 80 minute domestic to international transfer at JFK for a non US citizen?,1
