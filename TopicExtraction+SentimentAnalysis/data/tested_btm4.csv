930,"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!",3
932,@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.,3
933,@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.,3

939,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s,3
948,@united Thank you!,3
952,@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet,3
954,"@united but if i tweet the ID number, won't that reveal my home address to anyone on the web?",3
956,@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX,3
959,@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well,3
961,"@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on",3
962,@united I did... no response back,3
963,@united this is atrocious customer service.,3
967,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology,3
972,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.,3
980,@united I think DM would be better,3
982,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....,3
989,"@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so.",3
991,"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude.",3

1005,"@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.",3
1006,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.,3
1010,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?,3
1014,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.,3
1015,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb,3
1016,"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked.",3

1055,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.,3
1056,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful,3
1066,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.,3
1069,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints",3

4124,"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?",3
4128,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.,3
4129,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.,3
4141,@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM,3

10785,@USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?,3
10789,@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?,3

10852,@USAirways how can i get ahold of a reservations supervisor?,3
10853,@USAirways I called the BTV desk; they had more information - so it exists.  Your systems don't make it easy for the customer to access it.,3

12900,@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight,3
12901,@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.,3
12902,"@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing.",3
12906,@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk,3
12908,@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.,3
12909,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.,3
12910,@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.,3
12913,@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume,3

13012,@AmericanAir so whats the hold up on flight 4302?,3
13014,@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.,3
13016,@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.,3

13098,"@AmericanAir I love very much your planes, can you please follow me back? It's an amazing bussines!",3
13101,@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers,3

13110,@AmericanAir You don't care about keeping your customers safe or at least you didn't care about my sister,3
13111,@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.,3
13112,"@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too",3

14054,@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?,3
14060,@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!,3
14062,@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome,3
14065,"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is.",3
14068,"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled.",3
14069,@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....,3
14073,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses.",3
14080,"@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!",3
14086,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center,3
14096,@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers,3
14099,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca  easier",3

14146,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.,3
14150,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles,3
14153,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!,3
14157,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?,3

14274,@AmericanAir I can't keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue?,3
14276,@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer,3
14277,@AmericanAir 62 inches !?,3
14279,@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!,3
14281,"@AmericanAir Hmm. Looks like you looked at my tweet from last month, not this one. Was able to get U.K. agent to help me, thanks.",3
