1194,@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..,2
1202,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?,2
1208,"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver...""",2
1219,@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines),2
1222,@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united,2

1293,@united funny I paid to check my bag and now flight 1086 is BEGGING folks to check bags for free 1 hour before flight. #notcool,2
1294,"@united nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm",2

1311,@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight,2
1314,@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house,2
1315,@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.,2
1317,@united Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now.,2
1320,@united - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3?,2
1322,"@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to ""check in"" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa",2
1326,@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff,2

1328,@united Any news about the departure of the flight UA51?,2

1389,@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity,2
1395,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means.",2

1431,@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?,2
1432,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2,2
1443,@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?,2

1488,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.,2
1494,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.,2
1502,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke,2

1537,@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner,2

1546,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?",2

11095,@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility,2

13070,@AmericanAir well you spelled my name wrong.,2
13073,@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling,2
13077,@americanair thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.,2
13078,@AmericanAir 4 open kiosks for priority with no line and only 4 open for main check in for ~80-100 ppl,2
13091,@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.,2
13105,@AmericanAir SFO. Natt (the agent who helped me) really did an awesome job.,2
13106,@AmericanAir I paid seat upgrade b4 the severe weather.  Got booked on another flight but did not get upgrade. Was calling to inquire. HELP!,2
13108,@AmericanAir well Done all of you xx,2

13137,@AmericanAir I don't like making a scene but this hasn't been addressed properly. Please have them do that.,2
13140,@AmericanAir am on hold for the 2nd time today. Need help with confirming the new flights you arranged for me. Can you expedite this?,2
13167,@AmericanAir ...why would you sell seats for a 7 hour flight with half of the legroom occupied by an escape raft? http://t.co/DTHEyOFXrB,2
13206,@AmericanAir you have said the same thing to me over and over again but phrased differently. How about some actual help?,2
13213,@AmericanAir done.,2
13214,@AmericanAir would it be possible to change my flight on your website? Many thanks,2
13216,@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!,2
13229,@AmericanAir How am I supposed to Cancelled Flight it if I can't do it online?  I don't want to lose all the funds on the ticket.  HELP!!! :(,2
13236,@AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in,2
13240,@AmericanAir worst airline! You Cancelled Flight our flight and don't even let us know even though we are traveling with children.,2
13250,@AmericanAir @united we'll have time and they aren't doing a damn thing. I'm the guy in the winter hat and frowny face,2
13254,"@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra",2
13267,@AmericanAir Can you add my KTN to an existing reservation? It's not letting me add it online....,2
13270,"@AmericanAir confused at the definition of a ""preferred seat."" I paid extra for one and got a regular seat with no legroom. Unimpressed.",2
13299,@AmericanAir the most stressful morning and still had to pay to check a bag. LAX is a madhouse with a lot of angry customers. Yikes,2
13321,"@AmericanAir two were non revs, right?",2
13323,@AmericanAir finally called! Can't get met Seattle so refund will be processed. Thanks,2
13325,@AmericanAir the app doesn't allow Canadian address. I used the mobile Canadian site and it will not let you select a passenger.,2
13329,@AmericanAir is your website down? I haven't been able to check in to my flight all morning.,2
13343,@AmericanAir yes. Just sayin' that was a particularly poorly handled situation.,2
13344,"@AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was ""no longer available"" just because it wouldn't accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC",2
13347,@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.,2
13352,@AmericanAir Any way that we could look at other options for today?,2
13354,@AmericanAir @USAirways use the app you say?? http://t.co/WnY9TzsR8N,2
13364,"@AmericanAir  upon entering plane to 2 @USAirways stewardesses: ""can I have some water?"" ""no we don't do that. please take your seat""",2

13376,"@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted flights, now I'm rerouted and have over 12 hrs of travel but you will bump paying customers for non revs. #custserv",2
13380,@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs,2
13388,@AmericanAir although there was a 6 hour delay every single staff member from the ticket desk to the admirals club in was as sweet as pie,2
13392,@AmericanAir Kudos to ticket agents for #2224 for making passengers check bags that are too big to fit in overhead.,2
13393,"@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?",2
13397,@AmericanAir at LAX &amp; just got off the phone w/reservations. Every flight that'd get me to BOS before 11 am tmrw is apparently unavailable üòê,2
13401,"@AmericanAir It's our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted",2
13408,@AmericanAir I need to be back in Cleveland as early as possible tomorrow,2
13419,"@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice",2
13421,@AmericanAir does that mean my ktn is not in my reservation?,2
13423,"@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology",2
13439,@AmericanAir Filed a PIR with an agent at Indianapolis airport. Unable to pull up information online on your site. Have DMed details.,2
13440,"@AmericanAir I hear #Delta is offering 2,500 miles to frequent flyers if their bags doesn't come out within 20 minutes of landing thoughts?",2
13466,@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.,2
13486,last trip on @AmericanAir ... Poor customer service 3 trips in a row! @Delta here I come!,2
13496,@AmericanAir wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass,2
13499,"@AmericanAir Is it true, as FAs are saying, that you have no way to collect money from passengers (after door closing) who want a MCE seat?",2
13501,@AmericanAir a confirmed flight. I'm so done! Thanks for nothing!,2
13502,@AmericanAir Not necessary.  I am confident the excellent in-flight staff will make the appropriate report.,2
13527,"@AmericanAir @Active_Aly thx. We have already been on the iberia website, and seat reservation is unavailable. Hopefully we can call them.",2
13528,@AmericanAir this merger with @USAirways @usairwis a cluster of inefficiency and misinformation.  When is it going to be done?,2
13530,@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.,2
13546,@AmericanAir spent hour+ trying to check after to use military ID for luggage then messed up boarding pass &amp; forced into line again.,2
13579,"@AmericanAir Hello ! I cannot register for my tomorrow flight from Paris to Las Vegas ""This feature is currently unavailable"" appears ?",2
13592,@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.,2
13608,@AmericanAir why wont you find my luggage without blaming everyone else?,2
13609,@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure,2
13613,@AmericanAir Can you respond to my DM?,2
13621,"@AmericanAir but really, can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call",2
13624,@AmericanAir @emeyerson @ggreenwald Don't wait on a bag. Go to Walmart and get what you need for tomorrow morning.,2
13626,@AmericanAir Hi. I have KOA-LAX-PHL-ORD booked as a 1-way savr awrd. If I called to chnge it to KOA-LAX-PHX-ORD would I have to pay any fees,2
13637,@AmericanAir my bag is still in Miami and cannot be located?! How do you loose a bag like that? With a tag and everything?? (2),2
13640,"@AmericanAir Yep, was in one of my other camera memory card :D",2
13648,@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs,2
13658,@AmericanAir so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset,2
13666,".@AmericanAir @USAirways Add insult to injury you guys ""misplaced"" my bag.

13693,@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending,2
13696,@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers,2

13710,"@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?",2

13728,@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway,2
