3901,@United ticket counter Masters out of SMF not very helpful.,1
3905,@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!,1
3929,@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.,1
3935,"@united Thanks. UA1121, DEN, 40 min on tarmac.",1
3938,@united how come I have no baggage updates.,1
3945,@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?,1
3951,@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology,1
3952,"@united I am VERY disappointed with @SilverAirways as your partner. No communication, 2 extremely Late Flight flights. Really, all around horrible.",1
3956,"@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way.",1

3958,@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514,1
3961,@united I've been waiting on my bag in IAH for 45mins.  They're only 4 freaking people on that flight waiting for bags.  Fix this!!,1
3966,@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...,1
3968,@united do you guys have any working planes?,1
3971,@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!,1

3977,"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back",1
3981,@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival,1
3988,@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...,1
3992,@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.,1
4008,@united 618 was flight out of Houston,1
4010,@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.,1
4011,@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD,1
4020,@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive,1
4024,@united Give Cyndi &amp; Troy each a gold star.,1

4030,@united 3875 to Denver which we are supposed to be boarding right now but has yet to land,1
4034,@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY,1
4036,@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf,1
4044,"@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff",1
4045,@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.,1
4046,@united you guys suck. You delay flights but can't hold the connectors 10 minutes??? #WorstAirlineEver,1
4048,"@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United",1

4084,@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun,1
4088,@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport,1
4093,@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL,1
4095,@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?,1
4097,@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.,1
4103,@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!,1
4105,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!",1

4216,@united flt. 4567 departure time has changed five times in the last 20 minutes. Why don't you figure out a solution and announce once?,1
4217,@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.,1

4220,@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!,1
4222,@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude,1
4223,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.,1
4225,@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!,1

8929,@JetBlue Seems very likely.,1
8930,@JetBlue they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting,1
8933,@JetBlue why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC.,1

8953,@JetBlue Is today's JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it's not...,1
8958,@JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.,1
8959,@JetBlue sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer,1

9073,@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!,1

9153,@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.,1
9154,@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH,1
9158,@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14,1

9263,@USAirways very embarrassing.,1
9264,@USAirways I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.,1
9266,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs,1
9267,@USAirways and despite tailwind… Will still be Late Flight.,1

9289,@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays,1
9291,@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail,1
9297,@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.,1
